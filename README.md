# Traffic Optimization and Community Detection in California Road Networks

Utilized a large road network dataset to extract key insights by identifying important locations using centrality measures and
computing alternate routes in case of road closures. Applied network analysis to detect communities of interconnected
locations and assessed their quality using modularity. This project provided valuable insights into traffic patterns,
congestion points, and community structures to improve urban planning and traffic management.
